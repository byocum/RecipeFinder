# RecipeFinder
Food Finder - A personal recipe finder in which you can find recipies based on the ingredients that you want to use.  This project uses Asp.net MVC with the C# programming language, Razor, Bootstrap, Entity Framework code first and a SQL database.  This project helped me solidify what I have learned about Asp.net MVC and Razor as well as introduced me to Bootstrap and Entity Famework.
